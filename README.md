# Heart disease predictor using random forest
An algorithm using random forest to predict high and low risks of heart problems based on user inputs in the system.

## How to run the project:
- acess here: https://heartproblemdetector-bexlo7nsrd2dzxy3haemch.streamlit.app/

## Results and anaysis:
- use metrics such as: f1 score, precision, recall score, confusion matrix, and accuracy.
- I trained 3 models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. I thought XGBoost and Random Forest were overfitting, but I bet high and did many, many tests, eventually using Random Forest for the final model.

## mains technologies:
### Python:
- Scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib
- streamlit
